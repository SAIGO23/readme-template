## Hi there, my name is <strong>{Leonardo Macedo Pereira da Silva}!</strong>

> I am studying Geology (BA), doing research in the area of aerospace meteorology at the Institute of Aeronautics and Space, emphasizing data analysis in statistical models applied to improve operational decisions in rocket launches and soundings. Currently I am engaged in studying structural changes in the classroom, focusing on the transition of technological tools that transform the reality of the student and the pedagogy used in class.


🔭 I would like to collaborate on sharing data for the purpose of analyzing models applicable to AI and ML that can improve the process of educating scientists. 
I remain at your disposal.
